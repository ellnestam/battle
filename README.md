This is a game/simulation of a very simple bank.

### Introduction

Never before has starting a bank been so easy. You just need to launch the Bank Software (TM), register an IP-address with the central Bank Administration Committee servers and then clients and money will start to pour in. At least that what it says in the commercial.

The harsh reality is that you not only need to keep the software running, you need to evolve it too.

After your bank is up and running very simple business can be made. After that adaptations need to be made as clients need to be able to register new accounts, deposit money and withdraw money. If you fail to do that business will get lost. If customers can't withdraw money they will get angry and maybe withdraw their accounts. If the bank manages to server save customers but aren't able to meet customer demands for loans profits will plummet. Paying interest to customers with savings accounts while getting no profit from interest on loans will drain the funds of the bank quickly.

If you however can can keep up with the ever changing demands of clients and keep the sofware running at the same time your business will prosper.


# Battling

This game can be played against time or against others. If you play against time you 'only' need to stay in business, i.e not go below a certain given cash limit. If you play against others the bank with the most money when the game ends wins.
