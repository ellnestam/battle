This is a game/simulation of a very simple bank.

### Introduction

Never before has starting a bank been so easy. You just need to launch the Bank Software (TM), register an IP-address with the central Bank Administration Committee servers and then clients and money will start to pour in. At least that's what it says in the commercial.

The harsh reality is that once the software is running you need to keep it running, and you need to evolve it too.

If everyting goes according to plan you've got the bank up and running and very simple business can be made. After this initial grace period adaptations need to be made as the client base needs to grow and your customers need must be able to register new accounts, deposit money and withdraw money. 

If you fail to do that business will get lost. 

Customer must be able to withdraw money or they will get angry and maybe terminate their accounts. But, it's not as simple as that. If the bank manages to server its save customers but aren't able to meet customer demands for loans, profits will plummet. Every banker knows that paying interest to customers with savings accounts while getting no profit from interest on loans drains the funds quicker than you can say 'Availability Float'.

If you however can keep up with the ever changing demands of clients and keep the sofware running at the same time your business will prosper.


# Battling

This game can be played against time or against others. If you play against time you 'only' need to stay in business, i.e not go below a certain given cash limit. If you play against others the bank with the most money when the game ends wins.
